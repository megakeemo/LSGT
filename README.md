# Landslide Susceptibility GIS Tool

## Problem Definition
In Jamaica, landslides often result in significant damage to people and property. This is especially true during the hurricane seasons when there are frequent periods of heavy rainfall. Through scientific analysis of past landslides, we can assess and predict landslide susceptibility of other areas and thus decrease landslide damage through proper preparation and zoning. Currently most investigations of areas involve manually collecting data and performing calculations. These investigations range from one day to a month in order to calculate how susceptible the area is to landslides. Planners and developers face a major problem with financing these investigations; therefore the need to develop a cheaper method is very urgent. 

## Solution to the Problem
Identifying the problems involved with calculating the landslide susceptibility of an area, we decided to create a web-based application that will minimize the complexity and reduce the hassle involved with determining the susceptibility of an area. This application has a user friendly interface that can be used as long as the user has access to a computer with an internet connection thus making it accessibly and cheap as it requires no special hardware. The app, which we have named the Landslide Susceptibility GIS Tool (LSGIST), uses data obtained from the government’s geological database and uses it to perform calculations to determine an area’s susceptibility. It allows the user to specify the area for which the landslide susceptibility is to be calculated using a polygon drawn on the map provided in the interface. The output of this application is the probability of a landslide occurring in the area selected. This is denoted by a number between 0 and 1. There is also an option available in the app to display as overlays the different geological features which were used in calculating susceptibility. These features are the aspect, elevation, land use, lithology and slope. 

## Aims and Objectives
The aim of this project was to create an online, portable environment for the calculation of the landslide susceptibility of area. The objectives set out were accomplished and are as follows:

1. Develop an interactive, attractive and user friendly interface.
2. Create a database to store the various data needed in the calculations.
3. Perform calculations based on the data obtained from the database to determine the landslide susceptibility of an area in St. Mary, Jamaica.
